Welcome. This site showcases the computational projects, tools, and scientific outputs developed by our group, with a focus on molecular data analysis, cheminformatics, and machine learning for the study of metabolic diseases.


## Projects
- **MOLRAPTOR** — A pipeline for fetching, curating, and encoding molecular datasets into machine-learning-ready fingerprints.
- **MOSAIC** — A machine learning benchmarking toolkit for classification and model selection on tabular data.
- **CHAMANP** — A framework for curating and hierarchically organizing natural product molecular datasets.


## Tutorials
- [NumPy Tutorial](https://github.com/NanoBiostructuresRG/NumpyTutorial) — An introductory tutorial to NumPy covering linear algebra, testing, and debugging in Python.
